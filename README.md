Word in Context (WiC) Task
Algorithm to achieve as much accuracy as possible on the WiC
binary classification task. Each instance in WiC
has a target word w for which two contexts are
provided, each invoking a specific meaning of w.
The task is to determine whether the occurrences
of w in the two contexts share the same meaning
or not, clearly requiring an ability to identify the
word’s semantic category. The WiC task is defined
over supersenses (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados,
2019) – the negative examples include a word used
in two different supersenses and the positive ones
include a word used in the same supersense.
